# Elena--A-Python-based-cross-platform-virtual-assistant
Elena was designed with a motive of making a cross platform personal assistant that would seamlessly work with in any platform it is thrown into. As of now it's functionality is limited to certain extent to being a virtual assistant but I'm working with my team to make it more intelligent.
In this beta model, i'm plannning to add elena to have a skill to search anything over wikipidea and answer the information she gets over from there.
